reading notes:
- are we thinking of using subvocalizations?
	- should we have participants focus on specific words?
	- related words (ex: right/left) or unrelated (yes = forward, no = backward, etc)
- outside factors: gender, time of day, etc... should we consider?
	- probably after we get a working model lol
	- pretraining?
- where r we going to enough training data - limited
